# Pareto Distribution Simulation
This application provides a simulation of the Pareto Distribution.
It's operation can be described by the following thought experiment:
 1. Start with a pile of paper clips.
 2. Select a paper clip and remove it from the pile along with any
    paper clips attached to it.
 3. Select a second paper clip.
 4. Join the two paper clips together.
 5. Repeat a number of times from step 1.
 
What happens is that longer chains of paper clips are more likely to
form because it's more likely to select a paper clip which is part of
a long chain than is not part of a chain or is part of a small chain.

If run for long enough then approximately eighty percent of the paper
clips will be contained in twenty percent of the chains.  This is
where the so-called "80-20" rule comes from.
